# Random Message Generator - A Codecademy project

The program is part of my fullstack codecademy course.

## Overview

This will be a simple project using Objects, Arrays, and loops to create a program that will output a random message everytime the program is run.
In this case I chose random motiviational quotes, to support my own learning journey and to keep me motivated.
